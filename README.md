Quick overview
This toolkit brings together Cursor AI for navigation, planning, and automation with Claude Code for deep code intelligence. It helps teams implement agentic coding patterns, where AI copilots reason about goals, constraints, and impacts, then propose concrete steps that integrate into your development stack. The result is a smoother flow from idea to implementation, with real-time feedback, robust guardrails, and clear paths for customization.

Why this toolkit matters
- AI-assisted development accelerates delivery. You get faster ideation, faster coding, and faster debugging.
- Claude Code adds a focused, code-savvy assistant to complement Cursor’s orchestration and workspace awareness.
- The toolkit embodies agentic coding, an approach where AI agents set goals, plan actions, and execute with human oversight.
- You gain an extensible foundation. Build custom workflows, integrate with existing tools, and tailor behavior to your project’s rules.

How this kit fits into AI coding workflows
- Plan: Define goals, constraints, and quality gates for a feature or fix.
- Code: Generate or review code with Claude Code’s guidance, while Cursor manages context, history, and task tracking.
- Verify: Run tests, simulate scenarios, and validate outcomes with AI-assisted checks.
- Iterate: Refine code, re-run checks, and adjust plans as needed.
- Deliver: Merge changes with confidence, document decisions, and prepare release notes.

Core concepts and terminology
- Agentic coding: A pattern where AI agents reason, plan, and act toward goals within a coding project.
- Cursor AI: A tool for navigation, orchestration, and workspace awareness in coding tasks.
- Claude Code: An AI code assistant that understands programming tasks and can propose, review, and optimize code.
- SDK and API: Interfaces that let you build on top of the toolkit and connect to other systems.
